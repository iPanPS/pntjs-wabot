### Adding a New Command

To add a new Command, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `commands` folder with your desired functionality. For example, `ping.js`:

   ```javascript
   // commands/info-ping.js

   module.exports = {
       name: "ping",
       category: "info",
       code: async (ctx) => {
           const {
               status,
               message
           } = await global.handler(ctx, {
               admin: Boolean,
               botAdmin: Boolean,
               banned: Boolean,
               coin: Number,
               group: Boolean,
               owner: Boolean,
               premium: Boolean,
               private: Boolean
           });
           if (status) return ctx.reply(message);

           return ctx.reply("Pong!");
       }
   };
   ```

2. Your Command is now ready to use. Users can trigger it by sending `/ping` in the chat.
